My partner (Halie) and I estimate the time spent on this project to be somewhere around or slightly above 15 hours.

We originally planned to break this up by function and strutures, but it became more of a collaborative effort as time went on. Each aspect
was run by each other before implementing for sure, so we had a combination of doing it on our own time, then seeing if it worked well when we 
met. Somewhere between pair coding and dividing it up, technically.
